Incorporated in November 2014 in Singapore, the company is led by a core team with cumulative 30-years’ experience in finance, AI and big data analytics. Backed by institutional investors such as Jungle Ventures and Spring Seeds (a subsidiary of the Singapore Government), the company’s accolades include:  We are among the selected 21 companies which got accreditation from the government of Singapore for their stringent technology, finance and operations due diligence (www.imda.gov.sg/industry-development/programmes-and-grants/startups/accreditation-at-sgd) We won the first place in the MAS FinTech Awards (Singapore SME) in the regulatory compliance space from the Monetary Authority of Singapore for our approach to make the workflows in AML and Reconciliation scalable and highly auditable (beyond ML based black box approach) (www.mas.gov.sg/News-and-Publications/Media-Releases/2016/Ten-FinTech-companies-recognised-for-innovative-solutions-at-inaugural-FinTech-Awards.aspx) We are voted as one of the top 21 AI start-ups focusing on the financial services space by medici (www.letstalkpayments.com/medici-top-21-ai-companies/) We graduated from Nomura's corporate innovation program in November 2017 where we successfully delivered our product – Reconciliation Management Suite – in a pilot environment (https://inc42.com/buzz/nomura-voyager-fintech-accelerator-voyager-demo-day/)  In regulatory compliance, we focus on anti-money laundering and reconciliation and our products – Alerts Management Suite (AMS) and Reconciliation Management Suite (RMS) – cater to these areas, respectively. The mission or goal is to achieve 40% operational efficiency with significant savings in infrastructure and operational costs. Tookitaki's unique selling proposition (USP) is in our approach where we combine our proprietary modelling technique with our complete auditable framework to make the process dynamic and highly explainable (moving out of the black box approach). Moreover, our flexible on-premise and cloud-packaging capabilities, along with the option of easy integration to existing core-banking applications (REST API endpoints), make the solution deployment faster with lesser barrier to entry. Today, regulatory compliance processes have become more complex and fluidic, increasing the chances for rule-based models to fail. Banks need to move beyond static rule-based systems and adopt a new approach to prevent financial and reputation loss. Tookitaki bridges the gap with its innovative software products – AMS, RMS and PMS.","RequirementsRole: Business Analyst Responsibilities  Assisting the Project Manager in preparing project schedule and estimates.

Established in 1981, the School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering (EEE) is one of the founding Schools of the Nanyang Technological University. Built on a culture of excellence, the School is renowned for its high academic standards and strong tradition in research. To support teaching and cutting-edge research, EEE is host to 11 research centres and more than 50 laboratories, which are well-equipped with modern facilities and state-of-the-art equipment. With about 200 faculty members and an enrolment of more than 4,000, of which about 1,300 are graduate students, it is one of the largest EEE schools in the world. Job Description Traditional classroom teaching in universities is undergoing a paradigm shift. For instance, an emerging paradigm is team-based learning (TBL), where students work together in small groups in the classroom on group application exercises. It is not particularly well-understood yet how to guide students and teachers in TBL settings, and how to create suitable strategies to maximize learning in this setting. Moreover, it remains unclear how assessment can be rigorously conducted for TBL sessions and other alternative learning paradigms. Our long-term objective, over the next 4 to 5 years, is to design technological platforms that are capable of collecting and analysing real-life data in learning environments, and are able to generate objective assessments, in an automated fashion. The overall aim of this project is to make significant progress in the direction of this long-term objective. More concretely, we will adopt state-of-the-art speech and video processing technologies to 21st century learning and education settings, and conduct trials with such technologies in real-life teaching environments. Specifically, as a first step, we aim to develop speech processing algorithms that can detect speakers, language, gender, and social behaviour from audio recordings. Second, we will design video processing algorithms that can detect people, movement, gestures, and facial expressions. Third, we plan to combine these audio and video processing algorithms in order to characterize human behaviour during social and learning activities, and to apply these technologies in three test cases. At last, we will investigate correlations between the behaviours extracted automatically by the technological platforms and manually annotated behavioural scores. The latter are determined by independent trained observers, e.g., according to the Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS) or following the 5C model. In this way, we can validate the audio-video analytics platforms, and potentially predict CLASS (and other) scores automatically from audio or video recordings. The Research Fellow will assist in developing the software platform for this project.","Requirements PhD in Electrical Engineering 3-4 years of experience with machine leaning is a must Experience in data science and clinical data collection and research Excellent writing and presentation skills Analytical and critical thinking, creative, problem-solver Programming skills in Matlab, Python  We regret only shortlisted candidates will be notified."
