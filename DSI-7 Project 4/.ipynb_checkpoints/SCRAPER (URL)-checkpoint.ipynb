The Construction industry undertakes the world’s largest, most expensive, and complex projects ever dreamt of by mankind. Yet, the Construction industry is notoriously slow to adopt new technologies and as a result, there exists a large amount of inefficiencies and problems that Hubble can create positive value and make a great impact on. This impacts the homes people live in, offices people work in, and cities generations live in. There is no other industry where technology can have a greater impact. Bar none. Hubble’s vision is to build the pillars of trust for the Construction industry and we are on a mission to develop the autonomous self-building construction sites of tomorrow - powered by big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.. Our first step to our mission is to track the Man, Machine, Material, and Money (4M) data - for the Construction industry. The 4M data can be used to optimise operations at the worksites as well as to build an automated trading platform for the 4M. We have grown rapidly to become the market leader in each of the 4M verticals: 1. Man: We have more than 10,000 construction workers (~5% market share) on Hubble's platform and have tracked more than 35 million man-hours in total. 2. Machine: We track more than 1.5 million machinery transactions/year and have >US$100 million worth of machinery on Hubble's platform today. 3. Material: We developed Hubble Maps (Patent Pending) for precise indoor material and man tracking. We were awarded BCA's Innovation Grant 2018 and presented our technology to DPM Teo Chee Hean. 4. Money: We are deployed at iconic projects such as Project Jewel, Paya Lebar Quarters, Gardens by the Bay, and City Gate and have tracked more than $1 billion in project value. Interesting fact: We have grown rapidly without any venture funding to become the market leader in this space in less than 1 year. Our partners include the largest and most prestigious Construction companies such as Woh Hup, Lum Chang, Hexacon, Erect Group, Koh Kock Leong Enterprise, Chuan Lim Construction, and OAS Painting and Construction. We have also built the best engineering, product, and business team comprising the best and brightest of Singapore. We are a collegial set up and are extremely collaborative. We are hiring aggressively and are looking for motivated, smart, driven, and resourceful people to join our team. Who are we looking for: Hubble has entered into a 12 - 18 months partnership with 2 leading Data Companies who are experts in big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence - BoostML (see attached BoostML_Intro.pdf) and A*Star (see here) to help build up Hubble’s data infrastructure and strategy. BoostML will station 3 senior data scientists and engineers at Hubble full time over 18 months. We are looking for a talented Junior Data Scientist/Engineer who is passionate about this space and looking to learn the tools of the trade from the best in the business. You will be learning from BoostML and A*Star to build up Hubble’s data capabilities and take full ownership and leadership of this vertical at the end of 18 months after BoostML and A*Star completes the build up phase. This is an exciting and challenging role and our bet is on you. We want to groom and train you to become the future leaders in Hubble (see What Hubble will give you section). Your current mood: You want to be a data scientist but lack the ‘right’ paper qualifications for the job. You feel that you have talents in abundance but they are not recognised because of ‘paper qualifications’. You want to make an impact at work and make a dent in the universe. You want to be in a dynamic, fun, and energetic environment. You also want to be mentored by the best data scientists and engineers in Asia and aspire to take on leadership role in a fast growing startup. You want to step up to the plate now. You want to bat for home run and help build up the data capability of a fast growing company - Hubble. What Hubble will give you: Hubble is built by a team of talented, driven, and ambitious individuals. We do not subscribe to conventions. We do not let history and traditions dictate and limit our dreams to shape the world. We adopt the same mindset with our hiring. We are looking for the best and we want to bet on you. In this position, we will give you all the exposure and resources you need to eventually grow into the role of Head of Data. If you mindset is right, we promise you the ride of your life. Who will you be working with: If you connect with any of the description below, please apply immediately:  Purpose driven Hungry, ambitions, and self-motivated Meritocratic, results/performance > age/bureaucracy Resourceful, independent, chart our own destiny Determined, perseverance, and hard working Creative, innovative, out of the box  Yes, the above is everyone of us at Hubble.

Incorporated in November 2014 in Singapore, the company is led by a core team with cumulative 30-years’ experience in finance, AI and big data analytics. Backed by institutional investors such as Jungle Ventures and Spring Seeds (a subsidiary of the Singapore Government), the company’s accolades include:  We are among the selected 21 companies which got accreditation from the government of Singapore for their stringent technology, finance and operations due diligence (www.imda.gov.sg/industry-development/programmes-and-grants/startups/accreditation-at-sgd) We won the first place in the MAS FinTech Awards (Singapore SME) in the regulatory compliance space from the Monetary Authority of Singapore for our approach to make the workflows in AML and Reconciliation scalable and highly auditable (beyond ML based black box approach) (www.mas.gov.sg/News-and-Publications/Media-Releases/2016/Ten-FinTech-companies-recognised-for-innovative-solutions-at-inaugural-FinTech-Awards.aspx) We are voted as one of the top 21 AI start-ups focusing on the financial services space by medici (www.letstalkpayments.com/medici-top-21-ai-companies/) We graduated from Nomura's corporate innovation program in November 2017 where we successfully delivered our product – Reconciliation Management Suite – in a pilot environment (https://inc42.com/buzz/nomura-voyager-fintech-accelerator-voyager-demo-day/)  In regulatory compliance, we focus on anti-money laundering and reconciliation and our products – Alerts Management Suite (AMS) and Reconciliation Management Suite (RMS) – cater to these areas, respectively. The mission or goal is to achieve 40% operational efficiency with significant savings in infrastructure and operational costs. Tookitaki's unique selling proposition (USP) is in our approach where we combine our proprietary modelling technique with our complete auditable framework to make the process dynamic and highly explainable (moving out of the black box approach). Moreover, our flexible on-premise and cloud-packaging capabilities, along with the option of easy integration to existing core-banking applications (REST API endpoints), make the solution deployment faster with lesser barrier to entry. Today, regulatory compliance processes have become more complex and fluidic, increasing the chances for rule-based models to fail. Banks need to move beyond static rule-based systems and adopt a new approach to prevent financial and reputation loss. Tookitaki bridges the gap with its innovative software products – AMS, RMS and PMS.\",\n",

Incorporated in November 2014 in Singapore, the company is led by a core team with cumulative 30-years’ experience in finance, AI and big data analytics. Backed by institutional investors such as Jungle Ventures and Spring Seeds (a subsidiary of the Singapore Government), the company’s accolades include:  We are among the selected 21 companies which got accreditation from the government of Singapore for their stringent technology, finance and operations due diligence (www.imda.gov.sg/industry-development/programmes-and-grants/startups/accreditation-at-sgd) We won the first place in the MAS FinTech Awards (Singapore SME) in the regulatory compliance space from the Monetary Authority of Singapore for our approach to make the workflows in AML and Reconciliation scalable and highly auditable (beyond ML based black box approach) (www.mas.gov.sg/News-and-Publications/Media-Releases/2016/Ten-FinTech-companies-recognised-for-innovative-solutions-at-inaugural-FinTech-Awards.aspx) We are voted as one of the top 21 AI start-ups focusing on the financial services space by medici (www.letstalkpayments.com/medici-top-21-ai-companies/) We graduated from Nomura's corporate innovation program in November 2017 where we successfully delivered our product – Reconciliation Management Suite – in a pilot environment (https://inc42.com/buzz/nomura-voyager-fintech-accelerator-voyager-demo-day/)  In regulatory compliance, we focus on anti-money laundering and reconciliation and our products – Alerts Management Suite (AMS) and Reconciliation Management Suite (RMS) – cater to these areas, respectively. The mission or goal is to achieve 40% operational efficiency with significant savings in infrastructure and operational costs. Tookitaki's unique selling proposition (USP) is in our approach where we combine our proprietary modelling technique with our complete auditable framework to make the process dynamic and highly explainable (moving out of the black box approach). Moreover, our flexible on-premise and cloud-packaging capabilities, along with the option of easy integration to exiting core-banking applications (REST API end points), make the solution deployment faster with lesser barrier to entry. Today, regulatory compliance processes have become more complex and fluidic, increasing the chances for rule-based models to fail. Banks need to move beyond static rule-based systems and adopt a new approach to prevent financial and reputation loss. Tookitaki bridges the gap with its innovative software products – AMS, RMS and PMS. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\",\n",

Our approach is relentless performance-oriented software engineering vs. server sprawl in our customers' datacentres. You will use the latest high-end hardware and continuously devise ways to push the envelope of software performance. We build in-house systems if we must. We had to for indexing 1M 60-column rows/s, for aggregating high throughput event streams over hundreds of combinations of dimensions, and for pattern matching 5M patterns at 100Gb/s per 2RU. We use these to solve real customer problems. You will experiment wildly. For example we implemented network monitoring using a GPU, and we tested 4-socket machines with 2T RAM. Our current favourite platform is a 2-socket system with Platinum 8180 CPUs (112 lcores in total), 4x40Gbps NICs and 1T RAM, which we use to process 160Gbps. You will help us build a successful software platform for the long run. We invest a lot in flexibility, such as with our extensible rule engine and declarative aggregation system that empowers our analysts and helps us minimise the C code we have to write for supporting disparate use-cases. We know the devil is in the details. You will improve performance through better memory allocation systems and better data structures, all while ensuring that they are integrated with Address Sanitizer and fully tested using unit tests and end-to-end regression tests. We work end-to-end. You will implement data engineering solutions that are both efficient and secure for handling events from 500 million users, and to extract insight without leaking individual information. We want to show off. To attract the best programmers we plan to showcase our technology. You can be part of our effort to open-source interesting pieces of our technology stack. \\xa0 YOUR ROLE AS HIGH-PERFORMANCE DATA ENGINEER As a High-Performance Data Engineer, you will create and maintain tools, mainly in C, for crunching large amounts of data in files or streams. You will have to think both big, in terms of overall architecture, and small, in terms of low-level optimisations, to deliver solutions that are reusable, and match the performance of the best hardware. Every capability you add directly translates to new offerings made possible. Every percent of performance improvement directly translates to large cost savings. At the same time, the correctness and reliability of your work will be the cornerstone to our customers’ trust.\",\n",

The behavioral models in the long-term, agent-based simulator address household residential choice, vehicle availability, firm location and real-estate markets in a manner that is tightly integrated with an activity-based ‘mid-term’ model that estimates agent-specific ‘logsum’ accessibility measures for simulated daily activity patterns. The overall scope of FM research includes a number of projects on the development, and analysis of new and advanced forms of mobility options (such as on-demand mobility and autonomous vehicles), as well as on their urban planning and management implications.\\xa0 Both FM, and the SMART Centre, encourage exploration of new ideas and the use of ‘big data’ to advance our understanding of behavioral choices, urban activity patterns and the adoption of new forms of mobility. Responsibilities Depending upon project assignment and postdoc skills and interests, the specific responsibilities will involve some combination of the following:  Enhancing, estimating and calibrating the behavioral models in the long-term simulator, Generating and updating synthetic populations of residents, firms, and workers for particular cities at various points in time, Performing complex data analysis and integration of geospatial datasets, Contributing to the design and initiation of new research projects and ideas related to household and firm behavior as new options evolve for urban mobility and freight delivery, Presenting research results at international workshops, conferences, and exhibits as well as at internal project meetings, Co-authoring articles for publication in top-tier, peer-reviewed journals and conferences, and Monitoring the progress of project components, supervising PhD students, and regularly meeting with Principle Investigators.

       "  'Roles & ResponsibilitiesAppointments will be for a 3-year initial period with future prospects of a permanent position. The Centre for Climate Research Singapore (CCRS) is a research institute focusing on a number of weather and climate research areas which are of importance to Singapore and the wider Southeast Asian region. The centre is well supported with long-term core funding from the Singapore Government. In addition to the establishment of a number of research positions, a dedicated CRAY XC-40 has been installed to support modelling activities. The Centre also supports research groups in Singapore with external project funding. In the climate area there are four main threads to the existing and future research activities:  The generation of climate scenarios for Singapore and the Southeast Asian region. In 2015 a major climate assessment project was completed and currently CCRS is embarking on a new assessment project to be delivered in the next few years. This project involves the regional downscaling of global model projections to a finer resolution over Singapore and Southeast Asia and a scientific evaluation of the results. Sea level rise is a vital aspect of climate change for Singapore and a dedicated National Sea Level Project has been initiated at CCRS. Current and future work involves an in-depth analysis of the key results coming from climate change projections and a scientific understanding of the mechanisms governing climate change. The fundamental understanding of climate processes and mechanisms that are of first order importance to Singapore and the wider Southeast Asian region. These include tropical convection, monsoon dynamics, MJO and the role of remote tele-connections from ENSO and IOD. Working with global centres, we are also developing our capabilities in sub-seasonal to seasonal prediction for the Southeast Asian region. A better characterisation and understanding of decadal climate variability and the drivers of changes in extreme weather in the region is needed. Fundamental research in this area is part of the research programme at CCRS. Climate change impacts on water resources, human health, biodiversity, food security and the energy sector. These research areas will be pursued in collaboration with research groups in Singapore universities and research institutes.  We are looking for a team leader for the climate area to both develop and lead the science programme and to grow the group. We are seeking established scientists with an international reputation and a strong background in climate research. The specific job responsibilities will include:  Lead and line-manage the research team that is working to better understand and predict climate variability and change in Southeast Asia Undertake and publish their own research in topics important to the region Develop research plans for the climate research activities Provide scientific/technical guidance and training to team members Ensure the appropriate external representation of the centre’s climate work via national and international conferences and workshops Collaborate nationally and internationally with key institutions that lead in associated climate research activities. There is also the possibility of developing an affiliated academic position with local universities. Engage in an advisory capacity with national level stakeholders who are responsible for climate change policy and planning  Requirements  A PhD (or equivalent research experience) in a relevant physical science such as meteorology, oceanography, mathematics or physics At least 10 years of post-doctoral research experience, with a proven record of success as demonstrated by publications in peer-reviewed journals Demonstrated ability to inspire, lead and manage a team of PhD level researchers and technical experts Experience from participating in large research consortia Good written and verbal presentation skills  It is an advantage to have  Familiarity with tropical/Maritime Continent processes Experience of leading large scale research consortia '],\n",
